    <h2>Golf</h2>
    <p>
    I've been playing golf for 6 years now, recreationally and competitively. <br/>
    I am a member of Muskerry Golf Club, where I try to play at least once a week.
    Unfortunately, because of college I don't get to play as often as I used to, but 
    during the summer I always find time to get play a few holes at least 4 times a week.

    <h2>Football</h2>
    <p>
    All my life I have been playing football. <br/>
    Football was the first sport I ever played. There would be days when there 
    was nothing to do, so my friends and I would just go to the field and play 
    football all day long; in some instances we would stay out there all night too. 
    Football has also provided me with a lot of memories that I will never forget,
    and it has solidified many friendships in my life.</p>
